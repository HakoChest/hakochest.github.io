# Troubleshoting

This library was written in about a morning, so there are definitely many areas that need improvement. At present, it only meets the requirements of my own project and cannot guarantee that it will fully meet everyone's requirements.

So, if there are any problems with the code, or if you have any suggestions, please feel free to submit a PR or Issue, and I will handle it as soon as possible~

If you want to contribute code, please follow these rules:

- Follow the official Rust coding style
- Include test cases for new features
- Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before submitting
